Storytelling for the project:

Title: Food Preference Analysis

Objective: To analyze the food preferences of participants from different nationalities and age groups.

 i collected the dataset from kaggle  to understand the food preferences of people from different nationalities and age groups. the dataset consists of responses from 288 participants, with information about their nationality, age, and preferences for different types of food, juice, and desserts.

Through my analysis, i aim to identify patterns and correlations in food preferences across different nationalities and age groups. i will use visualizations to illustrate the distribution of participants by nationality, age, and gender, as well as the correlation between food, juice, and dessert preferences. my findings will provide insights into the food preferences of different demographics, which can be useful for food manufacturers, restaurants, and marketers.
